	<h2>CS 103 Link Text Examples</h2>

	<p>This page contains <strong>one</strong> example of good link text and <strong>five</strong> examples of link text that could be improved. Transform the five poor examples into five sentences with concise, readable link text that can be understood out of context (such as in an alphabetical set of links produced by a screen reader) and accurately represent the destination of the link.</p>

	<p>To fix the poor link text, download this file to your own computer, and use a text editor to change the link text (move the hyperlink to a different set of words in the sentence). Alternatively, you may change the text of these sentences if you prefer, as long as the results are still complete sentences and the meaning is unchanged.</p>
